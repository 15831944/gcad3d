Numerical control programs must be made at present in the mode MAN;
 see in addition Help / getting started  MAN.

 The numerical control words (RP, (STOP FED COOL INSERT.)) must be entered
 at present with the keyboard.

 With Alt-F "FROM", with Alt-W "WORK" is produced.
 Associated geometrical objects (points, outlines) can be selected.
 Conclusion with RETURN key or right mouse button.
 At each time one can re-establish each programstate with the cursor key up/down.

 You have to provide the partContour, starting points and workingContours
   with CAD or MAN.

# Example:
# start points:
P20=P(100 100)
P21=P(200 100)
P22=P(50,50)
P23=P(85 140 0)
P24=P(120 140 0)
P25=P(250 95 0)
P26=P(260 100)
P27=P(225 150)
# partContour
S20=REC P22 D(260 0 0) D(0 128 0)
# workingContours
S21=CCV  P23 P(92 140 0) P(95 150 0) P(100 150 0) P(103 140 0) P(110 140 0)
S22=CCV  P24 P(140 140 0) P(130 160 0) P24
