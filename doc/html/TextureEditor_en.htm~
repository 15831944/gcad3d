<h2>TextureEditor</h2>

 Textures can be applied to the following types of Surfaces:
  - Planar surfaces
  - Meshes.
  
  
Preparatory work:  
  Prepare the Images; eg with Gimp:
  - remove distortion: Tools/transformation/perspectiv
  - crop image: Tools/transformation/crop
  - scale image: Image/Image scale
    For automatic scaling you should scale the image to 100 pixels per meter
      (see "fixed size")


Activation of the TextureEditor:
  select a surface with the right mousebutton, select - "Texture".
  Exit with Esc-key or return-key or right mousebutton. 



  While the TextureEditor is active, you can move, scale and rotate
  the active texture with the mouse.
  The normal displayfunctions (moving and scaling the display with
  the mouse) are not active.
  Move: move the mouse with the Shift-key pressed.
  Scale: move the mouse with the Shift-key and the Ctrl-key pressed.
  Rotate: move the mouse with the Ctrl-key pressed.


<hr>
<b>Load texture from File</b>
 Load and activate a texture from a file:
 Select a JPG or BMP file;
 the texture name is now displayed as active texture
 and applied to the active surface.


<i>activate a Texture already in use:</i>
  Select a textured surface.
   the texture will be activated
   and applied to the active surface.



<b>Reload</b>
  Reloads the image of the active texture.
  (if eg. an image already loaded has been modified ..)
  

<b>mirror vertical</b>


<b>mirror horizontal</b>


<b>Remove Texture</b>
  Removes the texture of a surface.


<b>fit into</b>
  scales the image to the size of the surface


<b>fixed Size</b>
  100 pixels of the scaled image will cover 1 meter of the surface.
  Example: a tile has 100 cm x 50 cm;
    the Image should have 100 x 50 pixels;
    a surface of 5 x 2 units will have 5 x 4 tiles.

<b>Scale - Offest - RotAng / Modify Texture:</b>

 - Scale X / Y (Scale texture; cursor keys)
 - Offset X / Y (moving texture; cursor keys)
 - RotAng (torsion in degrees; Cursor-left/right)

  Modify the values with the keyboard: update with the return button.
  Modify the values with the cursor keys: updated dynamically.
  Next entry with the Tab key.


<hr>
Analyze dimensions from a photo:
  Equalize the photo.
  Create a surface from a rectangle (in Z=0) with the size of the photo;
  If the photo displays a area of 3 x 5 meters:
      S20=REC P(0 0 0) D(5 0 0) D(0 3 0)
      A20=S20
  Apply the texture.
  Set points  (Select / PT -- Position)
  Measure between points (Analyze Dist).




<b>Open / ToDo:</b>
 Export of textures with VRML ..
 Support of 16-bit-display
 Transparent textures ..
 Billboards ..
