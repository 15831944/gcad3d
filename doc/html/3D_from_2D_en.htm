<h2>Documentation application 3D_from_2D</h2>


The application allows you to create 3D curves by selecting
  Points on pixel images.
3-D surfaces can be generated from the 3D curves with CAD standard-functions.
There are 1 or 2 or 3 view images required.
The view images (formats. .jpg or .bmp) should have a view from above
and / or a side-view or front-view.


<b>Program call:</b>
    Start the user application "3Dfrom2D"
     - Select from the list of additional applications or
     - If application was active before: start with Ctrl-P.

<b>Exit the application:</b>
  Exit button or Ctrl + Esc.
  All data will be passed to the CAD model.

<b>Setup:</b>


to prepare:
  - Images (jpg's) of one, two or three views.
  - Photos must be equalized
    Editing images with Gimp for example:
    - Equalizing with: Tools / Transform / Perspective
    - Cut with: Tools / Transform / Crop
  - 90-degree turns should be made with the image editing program
    Gimp: Image / Transform / Rotate 90 degrees
  - Very large photos (over 4000 pixels - depending on the graphics card)
    should be reduced with an image editing program.


  <b>Top / Side / Front View</b>
    Definition of images (selected from file list).
    Top view: contains horizontal X-axis, vertical y-axis.
    Side view: contains horizontal X-axis, vertical Z-axis.
      Located above the top view.
    Front view: Z-axis has horizontal, vertical Y-axis.
      If the right of the top view.
  
    ^ Z
    |-----+
    | Side |   X
    +-----+---->

    ^ Y ^ Y
    |-----+          |------+
    | Top |    X     | front | Z
    +-----+---->     +------+---->
  
    After the definition of the view images, the zero points of the
    three basic axes must be defined -
    - Click into view images, 
      click again to indicate horizontal or vertical.
    The base levels will be shown as red lines.
  
  
  <b>X-lines</b>
    Generating one or two horizontal guides in
    Top view or side view. Esc = Delete last.
  
  
  <b>Y-lines</b>
    Generating one or two vertical guides in
    Top view or side view. Esc = Delete last.
  
  
  <b>Z-lines</b>
    Generating one or two guidelines in
    Side view or front view. Esc = Delete last.


  <b>Scale</b>
    Select the input corresponding to the view;
      change the values with the cursor keys up / down.
  
  
  <b>Offset</b>
    Select the input corresponding to the view;
      change the values with the cursorkeys left / right or
      up / down.
  
  
  <b>Angle</b>
    Select the input corresponding to the view window;
      change the values with the cursorkeys left / right.

<h2>2D to 3D:</h2>
  Create objects. Objects will be displayed in 2D-space;
    when the application exits all objects will be copied into 3D-space.


  <b>import CAD Point</b>
    Creates 2D-points of points or end points of curves.
    Use it to generate curves.
    Select a CAD-point or CAD-curve.


  <b>import CAD-plane</b>
    Generates 2D-planes  of 3D-CAD-planes
    Use it to generate curves.
    Select a CAD plane.


  <b>Plane</b>
    First create all planes at which curves or
      common points are located.
    Planes are shown as red lines.
    Create a plane through the selection of 2 points in one view;
      The second point is used to define horizontal or vertical.
    Top view - horizontal: an X-Z plane.
    Top view - vertical: a Y-Z plane.
    Side view - horizontal: an X-Y plane.
    Side view - vertical: a Y-Z plane.
    Front view - horizontal: an X-Z plane.
    Front view - vertical: an X-Y plane.
    Esc clears last created level.


  <b>Point</b>
    If several curves have a common point, first this point
      should be created; afterwards use this point.
    Select the point in 2 different views.
    If the point is on a plane, select the plane
      for the second view (2D-plane or CAD-plane).
    Esc clears last point created.


  <b>Polygon</b>
  <b>Spline</b>
    Select all points of the curve in a view, then
      (In reverse order) in a different view.
    Esc clears the last selected point.
    If an item is out of a photo: indicate the position in the
    corresponding height inside the photo.
    If a point is on a plane, the plane should be selected.
    If the entire curve lies in a plane, select the plane
      for the second view (2D-plane or CAD-plane).

  
  <b>Circle</b>                not yet implemented

  <b>Delete</b>
    Delete 2D objects.
    Select the object.
  
  
  <b>MirrXZ</b>
    Flip an object around the X-Z plane.
    Select the object.
  
  
  <b>MirrYZ</b>
    Flip an object around the Y-Z plane.
    Select the object.
