 Textures can be applied to Surfaces


<b>2D textures for tags:</b>
  A picture is display always normal to the viewer.
  Interactive activation: <a href="CAD_TxtG_de.htm#F11">CAD / N-Image</a>

 Textures can be applied to the following types of Surfaces:
  - Planar surfaces
  - Meshes.

   Scale and offset for x and y separately defined.
  Imagecorrection eg with Gimp:
  - remove distortion: Tools/transformation/perspectiv
  - crop image: Tools/transformation/crop
  - scale image: Image/Image scale
    For normal quality scale one meter to 100 pixels

Analyze dimensions from a photo:
  
Using a photo size should be analyzed:
  Equalize the photo.
  Create a surface from a rectangle (in Z=0) with the size of the photo;
  If the photo displays a area of 3 x 5 meters:
      S20=REC P(0 0 0) D(5 0 0) D(0 3 0)
      A20=S20
  Apply the texture.
  Set points  (Select / PT -- Position)
  Measure between points (Analyze Dist).




<b>Open / ToDo:</b>
