- Boolean operations with surfaces 


____________________________________________________________________________

- Add offset-surfaces

____________________________________________________________________________

- interactive editor - modify object:
    - display objects not affected dimmed,
    - update child-objects dynamic.
    - "edit object" n MAN and CAD shall display all objects following dimmed.
Example:

P20=P(20 0 0)
C20=P20 50
A20=C20
L20=P20 P(100 0 0)

Edit obj C20 (eg change radius 50)
- P20 - displayed normal;
- C20 - hilited; active obj to be modified,
- A20 - dimmed; following the obj C20 and child of C20 (depending bj)
- L20 - dimmed; following, not child of C20.

- Project and Mirror currently only for individual objects, not for CCV (currently Translate only).


- update interactive editor to modify B-splines. 

- Transformation of 3D Text: currently is always set in the XY plane.

- NC machining is graphically not yet active in the transformed reference system.

- NC-function are not yet completely implemented for alternative construction-planes

- Function for interactive positioning of sub-models to a contact position.

- Drawing 2D from 3D has not yet been implemented.

- With hatching, no islands are possible yet

- The programming interfaces are only partially documented.

- Step-Export only partially implemented
